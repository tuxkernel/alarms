# Simple bash scripts alarms
**Description:**

Simple bash scripts alarms for daily use. 

Do you want a cup of coffee? Go to the kitchen and prepare coffee in the coffee-maker. Then back to your laptop or workstation, run the script named "coffee" and eight minutes later you'll get a beep sound and message like "Coffee is ready! on your desktop. Down to the kitchen, pour your cup of coffee and keep working. Sometimes you are so focused on the computer that you forget that you were preparing coffee. As you can see, the script reminds you that the coffe is ready.

**Tasks:**

- Coffee
- Microwave popcorn
- Microwave ramen
- Snooze
- Wake up
- Water heater 
- water pump.

**Requirements:**

- bash (4.4.12 or above)
- mplayer (1.3.0 or above)
- zenity (3.22.0 or above)

**Installation:**

The scripts requires bash, mplayer and zenity programs installed before. Open a terminal and type:

**$ sudo apt-get install bash mplayer zenity**

Then download it:

**$ wget https://github.com/tuxkernel/alarms/archive/master.zip**

and unzip it:

**$ unzip master.zip**

Navigate to directory:

**$ cd alarms-master/**

Now move the scripts to /usr/bin/:

**$ sudo mv coffee popcorn ramen snooze wakeup water-heater water-pump /usr/bin**

Navigate to /usr/bin/:

**$ cd /usr/bin**

and make executable:

**$ sudo chmod +x coffee popcorn ramen snooze wakeup water-heater water-pump**

and change the owner. For example:

**$ sudo chown blackout:blackout coffee popcorn ramen snooze wakeup water-heater water-pump**

**NOTE:** Change **blackout:blackout** for your user name.

Finally, just run as:

**$ coffee**

# Add sound

By default, the directory of beep alarm scripts is /home/blackout/.sounds/alarm.mp3

Then open a terminal and type:

**$ mkdir .sounds**

Just copy **alarm.mp3"** to **/home/YOURUSERNAME/.sounds**

If your **YOURUSERNAME** is other, you must edit (with your favorite text editor) each script manually and change the path to "alarm.mp3". For example:

That's all.

# Add Shortcuts

If you are using MATE Desktop like me, you can add shortcuts in task bar. Right click on task bar and select "Add to panel".

Now right click over "Caj贸n" and select "add to Caj贸n".

In the box, select "Custom Launcher"

![Sample Run](https://github.com/tuxkernel/alarms/blob/master/screenshots/04.png)

and fill with the following:

- Type: Application
- Name: Coffee
- Command: /usr/bin/coffee
- Comment: Prepare coffee

![Sample Run](https://github.com/tuxkernel/alarms/blob/master/screenshots/05.png)

Do the same with the others scripts.

Finally, left click over "Caj贸n" and select your task. For example, Popcorn:

Three minutes later, you'll get a beep sound and message on the desk.

Then down to the kitchen and take your bag of popcorn.

That's all. Enjoy it!
